 T5 is used for Neural Machine Translation, with a specific emphasis on adapting it to translate English to French using the OPUS Books dataset's English-French subset. The evaluation of the model's effectiveness will involve the application of BLEU and SacreBLEU metrics. Additionally, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) has been utilized for German to English translation, showcasing a versatile approach by employing different models for distinct language pairs.
